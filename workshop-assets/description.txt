[h2]Repair the Emergency Broadcast System[/h2]
[quote]
Do you...
[list]
[*]...find yourself late in the game with nothing to do?
[*]...want to have a reason to travel around Knox Country from tiem to tine?
[*]...take your hourly weather updates and air traffic alerts for granted?
[/list]

[b]Save Our Station[/b] spices up your survival experience by causing the Automated Broadcast System to occasionally suffer service outages. Sometimes, a system can start failing completely, requiring you to seek out the failure and fix the issue.

Whilst the AEBS is built with emergency scenarios in mind, the backup systems only last so long...

[h2]How it Works[/h2]
[quote]
At the end of every emergency broadcast, the AEBS will report on system integrity, communicating the status of the Emergency Broadcast System.

Once the power shuts off in Knox Country, there's a chance the Emergency Broadcast System will start to fail.

During an interruption, the AEBS will be unavailable - but such outages will resolve themselves after some time. However, should a more serious fault occur, the network will run a self-test - a process that may take several days. Upon completion, a location and diagnostic code will be broadcast.

Refer to NWS (National Weather Service) Diagnostic Manuals and NWS Registers to find and troubleshoot any issues.

The NWS Diagnostic Manual will tell you what is wrong (and any items you need to resolve said fault), whilst the NWS Register will tell you where to find the weather station in question.

Enter the control room of the appropriate weather station, and perform the repairs by right clicking on one of the weather terminals. Once the repairs are complete, the next Emergency Broadcast will be sent, hopefully loud and clear... until the next fault occurs!

[h2]What's New in Knox Country[/h2]
[quote]
Five new locations have been added to the vanilla map, in the outskirts of West Point, Riverside, Muldraugh, Rosewood, and [spoiler]REDACTED[/spoiler]. In addition to weather stations, each location includes additional points of interest, such as a dirt race track, a diner, secluded homes, [spoiler]REDACTED[/spoiler], and much more!
[/quote]

[h2]New Items[/h2]
[quote]
To help troubleshoot faults in the Emergency Broadcast System and find weather stations, two new items have been added to the game.

[b]- NWS Diagnostic Manual -[/b]
[list]
	[*]The National Weather Service Diagnostic manual provides the information you need to interpret the diagnostic codes thrown by the Emergency Broadcast System during a fault.
[/list]
[b]- NWS Register -[/b]
[list]
	[*]The National Weather Service Register contains the locations of all civilian weather stations, as well as a general layout of the major roads in Knox Country.
However, you may not find [spoiler]REDACTED[/spoiler] on a typical NWS Register - but with some luck, someone may have written it down before the apocalypse...
[/list]

Since these are technical publications with a niche appeal, they are pretty rare.
Try your luck at the local bookstore, library, or home bookshelf. If you happen across a weather station, there's a good chance you'll find them in the control room, or in the trunk/glovebox of parked NWS Vehicles.

[h2]Sandbox Options[/h2]
[quote]
[b]Save Our Station[/b] now supports [b]Sandbox Options[/b] for adjusting various configuration options, such as:
[list]
	[*]Toggle for the Knox-Power Grid failure requirement.
	[*]Toggles for enabling/disabling Faults and Interruptions individually.
	[*]Various "profiles" with different chances for Faults and Interruptions.
	[*]Choosing a time multiplier, in case you are on a server or have longer hours.
[/list]
These settings support "hot-reloading" on both Dedicated and Host-Mode Servers via the Admin Menu. For Singleplayer, you can use a Mod like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894296454]Change Sandbox Options (by Star)[/url] to edit them in an existing world.

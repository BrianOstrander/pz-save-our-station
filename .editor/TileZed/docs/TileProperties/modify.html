  <title>Modifying Tile Properties</title>

  
</head><body>
You may add commands to the TileProperties.txt file that will modify
the properties in a .tiles file as it is read in.&nbsp; This can be
useful if you want to add, rename, or remove properties or change the
value of properties on many tiles without having to edit each one.<br>

<br>

To add a command, place one or more blocks named "modify" in
TileProperties.txt.<br>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">modify<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command = arg<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command = arg arg<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command = arg arg arg arg<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ....<br>}<br>modify<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command = arg<br>}<br>....</pre>
Each "modify" block has a list of one or more commands that will be
executed in order on the set of properties read in for every tile in a
.tiles file.&nbsp; All of the modify blocks are processed on every
tile's properties in the order the modify blocks appear in
TileProperties.txt.<br>
<br>
Any of the arguments to a command may be enclosed in double-quotes
"...".&nbsp; If you wanted to match an empty value, just write "".<br>
<h2>Command: match</h2>
match = property<br>
match = property value<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">match</span> command looks for
either a property or a property/value pair.&nbsp; If no matching
property is found, then none of the other commands after the <span style="font-weight: bold;">match</span> command in the current modify block will be executed.<br>
<h2>Command: reject</h2>
reject = property<br>
reject = property value<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">reject</span> command has the opposite effect of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">match</span> command.&nbsp; If a tile <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> have a property set, then none of the commands after the <span style="font-weight: bold;">reject</span> command in the current modify block will be executed.<br>
<h2>Command: remove</h2>
remove = property<br>
remove = property value<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">remove</span> command removes the
named property from the set of properties on a tile.&nbsp; If no value
is given, then the named property is removed regardless of the value.<br>
<h2>Command: rename</h2>
rename = old_name new_name<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">rename</span> command changes the
name of a property called old_name to new_name.&nbsp; If the property
called old_name isn't found on a tile, this command has no effect.<br>
<h2>Command: replace</h2>
replace = property1 value1 property2 value2<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">replace</span> command removes the
property1/value1 pair and adds the property2/value2 pair.&nbsp; If the
property1/value1 pair is not found, then this command has no effect.<br>
<h2>Command: set</h2>
set = property value<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">set</span> command sets the value
of a property.&nbsp; This command sets the property/value even if the
named property is not already set on a tile.<br>

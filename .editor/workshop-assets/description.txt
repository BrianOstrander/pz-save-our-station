Do you...
[list]
[*]...find yourself late in the game with nothing to do?
[*]...want new areas to explore in Knox Country?
[*]...take your hourly weather updates and air traffic alerts for granted?
[/list]

[b]Save Our Station[/b] spices up your survival experience by causing the Automated Emergency Broadcast System to occasionally suffer service outages. Travel to weather stations scattered around Knox Country to find, diagnose, and fix the broadcast system.

Whilst the AEBS is built with emergency scenarios in mind, the backup systems can only last so long...

[h2]How it Works[/h2]
[quote]
At the end of every emergency broadcast, the system's integrity will be reported, communicating the status of the Emergency Broadcast System.

Once the power shuts off in Knox Country, there's a chance the Emergency Broadcast System will fail.

[b]System Faults[/b]

When a system fault occurs, the network will run a self diagnosis - a process that may take several days. Upon completion, a location and diagnostic code will be broadcast. 

Refer to NWS - National Weather Service - Diagnostic Manuals and NWS Registers to find and troubleshoot the issue. 

The NWS Diagnostic Manual will tell you what is wrong, and the items needed to resolve thefault. The NWS Register will tell you where to find the weather station in trouble. 

Enter the control room of the appropriate weather station, and perform the repairs by right clicking on one of the weather terminals. Once the repairs are complete, the next Emergency Broadcast will be broadcast loud and clear... until the next fault occurs!

[b]System Inturruptions[/b]

For a more punishing experience, system interruptions can be enabled from within your sandbox settings. These interruptions are temporary system faults, during which the Emergency Broadcasts system will be unavailable.

[h2]What's New in Knox Country[/h2]
[quote]
Five new locations have been added to the vanilla map, in the outskirts of West Point, Riverside, Muldraugh, Rosewood, and [spoiler]REDACTED[/spoiler]. In addition to weather stations, each location includes additional points of interest, such as a dirt race track, a diner, secluded homes, [spoiler]REDACTED[/spoiler], and much more!
[/quote]

[h2]New Items[/h2]
[quote]
To troubleshoot faults in the Emergency Broadcast System and find weather stations, two new items have been added to the game.

[b]- NWS Diagnostic Manual -[/b]
[list]
	[*]The National Weather Service Diagnostic manual provides the information you need to interpret the diagnostic codes thrown by the Emergency Broadcast System during a fault.
[/list]
[b]- NWS Register -[/b]
[list]
	[*]The National Weather Service Register contains the locations of all civilian weather stations, as well as a general layout of the major roads in Knox Country.
However, you will not find [spoiler]REDACTED[/spoiler] on a typical NWS Register - but with some luck, someone may have written it down before the Knox Event started...
[/list]

Since these are technical publications with a niche appeal, they are pretty rare.
Try your luck at the local bookstore, library, or home bookshelf. If you happen across a weather station, there's a good chance you'll find them in the control room, or in the trunk and glovebox of parked weather service vehicles.

[h2]Sandbox Options[/h2]
[quote]
[b]Save Our Station[/b] now supports [b]Sandbox Options[/b] for customizing your play style, such as:
[list]
	[*]Toggle for the Knox-Power Grid failure requirement.
	[*]Toggle for enabling/disabling Faults and Interruptions individually.
	[*]Reliability profiles for determining the frequency of faults and interruptions.
	[*]Time multiplier, for increasing or decreasing how rapidly faults and interruptions progress.
[/list]
These options can be changed at any time, on both Dedicated and Host-Mode Servers, via the Admin Menu. Singleplayer users can set them when starting a new game, or can use a mod like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894296454]Change Sandbox Options (by Star)[/url] to edit them in an existing world.
